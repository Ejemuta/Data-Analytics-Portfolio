# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my skills in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, and Data Science through projects that simulate real-world business and energy sector scenarios. Each project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights and build interactive dashboards to support decision-making.
Tools & Technologies:
SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) – querying, aggregations, joins, stored procedures
Tableau / Power BI – dashboard development & data visualisation
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) – data analysis & machine learning
Excel – data cleaning, pivot tables, quick analytics
